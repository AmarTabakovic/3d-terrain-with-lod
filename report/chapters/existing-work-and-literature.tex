\chapter{Existing Work and Literature}
This chapter gives an overview of the current state of terrain LOD research 
and lists the main literature and resources used in this projet.


\section{Research Articles and Publications}
Terrain LOD is a well-researched topic. 

\section{Level of Detail for Computer Graphics}
\textit{Level of Detail for Computer Graphics} by Luebke et al. \cite{lodfor3dgraphics} is a reference book for 
         LOD rendering published in 2002. The book builds on top of years of research in the 
         area of LOD and provides an overview to many LOD techniques. For this project,
         chapter 7 ``Terrain Level of Detail'' of the book is especially relevant, as it dives into the topic of LOD for terrains specifically.
         It covers basic approaches and techniques for terrain LOD, 
         common problems that can occur during rendering of terrains and their solutions, and a catalog of terrain LOD algorithms.
         Many of the described terrain LOD algorithms originated from research publications.

\section{Virtual Terrain Project}
The \textit{Virtual Terrain Project} \cite{vtp} was a project run from 2001 to 2013 
that consisted of a collection of software, information and resources on terrain modelling and rendering.
