\chapter{Existing Work and Literature}
This chapter starts off by presenting some of the existing algorithms and approaches to terrain rendering.
Afterwards, a selection of real-world systems are given, in which terrain LOD algorithms are used.

\section{Algorithms and Approaches for Terrain LOD}
Terrain LOD is a well-researched topic and over the last three decades, numerous approaches have been published.
In the following, some of the most important publications are listed in chronological order.
The approaches that are described in greater detail in the upcoming subsections are highlighted in \textbf{bold}:

  \item \textbf{``Concurrent Binary Trees (with application to longest edge bisection)''} \cite{cbt} by Dupuy in 2020.
\end{itemize}
In the following subsections on the algorithms, all presented ideas are taken from their respective original publications,
unless noted otherwise.

\subsection{ROAM}
\textit{ROAM} (short for \textbf{R}eal-time \textbf{O}ptimally \textbf{A}dapting \textbf{M}eshes) 
is a terrain LOD algorithm developed by Duchaineau \textit{et al.} \cite{roam} published in 1997.
ROAM represents the terrain mesh using bintrees and performs triangle splits and merges
for generating and removing detail.

The central idea of the algorithm is to use temporal coherence: often, between two frames 
the meshes are very similar. This means that the mesh from a previous frame can be used to compute 
the mesh of the current frame, rather than building up the mesh from ground up.
This is done using two priority queues: a split queue $\mathcal{Q}_s$ and a merge queue $\mathcal{Q}_m$.
The split queue contains splittable triangles $T$
and the merge queue contains mergable triangle pairs $(T,T_B)$.
At each frame, the terrain mesh gets split and merged using $\mathcal{Q}_s$ and $\mathcal{Q}_m$. until either the required size/accuracy is reached
or the time runs out. 
The splits and merges always result in a continuous mesh, i.e. the mesh cannot contain any 
T-junctions.
The elements of $\mathcal{Q}_s$ and $\mathcal{Q}_m$ are ordered by 
various geometric error metrics, some of which are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Nested bounding volumes named \textit{wedgies}, which are defined to include the entire $x$ and $z$ extent of a triangle and its subtriangles 
        plus some padding space above and below the highest and lowest points respectively. Wedgies are computed while building the initial mesh at the beginning of the algorithm.
  \item Another metric is the distance between where a node is supposed to be on the screen and where the algorithm actually placed the node.
        The maximum of all distances is calculated and used as the base priority metric of the algorithm.
\end{itemize}

While the bintree trees gets traversed, various flags are updated which indicate whether a wedgie is inside the view-frustum, partially or not at all.
ROAM is designed as a greedy algorithm, meaning it will always performs the most optimal splits/merges for each frame.


\subsection{GeoMipMapping}
\textit{Geometrical Mipmapping (GeoMipMapping)} is a terrain LOD approach published by de Boer \cite{geomipmapping} in the year 2000.
The central idea of GeoMipMapping is its analogy to texture mipmapping: just like how textures of far away objects are rendered using lower resolution texture mipmaps,
terrain areas that are far away from the camera should also be rendered with a lower resolution mesh.

This is achieved by splitting up the terrain into so-called \textit{blocks} (also called \textit{patches}) of a fixed side length $2^n + 1$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
Each block has a LOD level\footnote{The original GeoMipMapping paper uses 0 to denote the maximum LOD level and vice-versa for the minimum LOD level. In order to avoid any confusion with the term \textit{LOD}, this report denotes 0 as the minimum LOD level and vice versa for the maximum LOD level.} $0\leq l \leq n$ that changes dynamically at runtime.
Each representation of a block at a specific LOD level is called a \textit{GeoMipMap}.
For each GeoMipMap, the number of vertices on one side is $2^{l}+1$ and the number of quads is $2^{2l}$.
Figure~\ref{fig:geomipmapping-patch-example} shows an example of a $5 \times 5$ block at LOD levels 2, 1 and 0.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \subfloat[\centering LOD level 2 (maximum).]{{\includegraphics[width=0.28\textwidth]{geomipmapping-level-2.png} }}
  \qquad
  \subfloat[\centering LOD level 1.]{{\includegraphics[width=0.28\textwidth]{geomipmapping-level-1.png} }}
  \qquad
  \subfloat[\centering LOD level 0 (minimum).]{{\includegraphics[width=0.28\textwidth]{geomipmapping-level-0.png} }}
  \caption{Example of each GeoMipMap of a $5 \times 5$ block. The omitted vertices of lower LOD GeoMipMaps are marked as dotted circles (based on \cite{geomipmapping}).}\label{fig:geomipmapping-patch-example}
\end{figure}

The organisation of the terrain into blocks allows for easy view-frustum culling, which is performed 
with a quadtree, where each node contains the AABB of its four children and the leaf nodes 
contain the actual blocks.

The LOD level for each block is selected at runtime and is based on the 
screen-space error that is caused by changing the LOD level of a block.
When the LOD level of a block changes, vertices get added or removed from the block,
which causes a difference in height $\delta$ between the two GeoMipMaps of that block. Projecting $\delta$ into 
screen-space yields $\varepsilon$. 
This $\varepsilon$ can be limited with a threshold $\tau$, such that 
the change in LOD level occurs only if $\varepsilon < \tau$.
The LOD selection can be sped up by pre-computing $\varepsilon$ per GeoMipMap and storing it in a look-up table.

GeoMipMapping avoids cracks by checking the four neighboring blocks
of a block and omitting the vertices that would cause cracks in the terrain.
The vertex omission is performed by rendering the bordering row/column of the current block
as triangle fans, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:geomipmapping-crack-avoidance}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{geomipmapping-crack-avoidance}
  \caption{Example of GeoMipMapping's crack avoidance between a LOD 2 and a LOD 1 GeoMipMap of two $5 \times 5$ blocks (based on \cite{geomipmapping}).}\label{fig:geomipmapping-crack-avoidance}
\end{figure}

Some further optimizations that were mentioned, which extend the just described basic GeoMipMapping algorithm, 
are \textit{trilinear GeoMipMapping} (i.e. morphing the vertices at LOD transitions similarly to trilinear mipmapping),
and \textit{progressive GeoMipMap streaming}.

\subsection{(GPU-based) Geometry Clipmaps}
Geometry Clipmaps \cite{geomclipmaps} is a terrain rendering technique published by Hoppe and Losasso in 2004.
A follow-up GPU-based variant of Geometry Clipmaps \cite{gpugeomclipmaps} was published in GPU Gems 2 by Hoppe and Asirvatham in 2005.
In this section, the basic features of the GPU-based Geometry Clipmaps algorithm are described,
and we leave out some more advanced features, such as compression and noise-generated details.

The algorithm is based on a single flat mesh centered around the camera.
The flat mesh is organized as a set of nested rings of $l$ levels, 
where the innermost level $l-1$ is a filled-in $n \times n$ grid, and where the ring at level $i$ is twice as big as the ring 
at level $i + 1$. This $n$ must be of the form $2^k - 1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. 
Each ring at a level is organized into 12 blocks of size $m \times m$, where $m = (n+1)/4$.
Gaps inbetween the blocks are filled up with special types of blocks, namely the $m \times 3$ \textit{ring fix-up} and the $(2m+1) \times n$ \textit{interior trim}.
In order to avoid T-junctions, a string of degenerate triangles is rendered at the border between blocks of 
different size. Since each block is identical up to translation and uniform scale, they get stored once on a vertex and index buffer 
and translated and scaled in the vertex shader at runtime, which greatly reduces memory consumption.
Figure \ref{fig:geometry-clipmaps-mesh} shows an example of this mesh. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{geometry-clipmaps-mesh}
  \caption{Example of the flat mesh in Geometry Clipmaps with $n = 15$, $m = 4$ and $l = 3$ (based on \cite{gpugeomclipmaps}).}\label{fig:geometry-clipmaps-mesh}
\end{figure}

In the vertex shader, the algorithm samples the height values from the heightmap texture.
Additionally, it performs the calculations for the so-called \textit{transition regions}, 
which are regions near the border of two levels in which 
the levels get morphed, so that the transition between levels is smooth and no popping occurs.
The morphing is performed by computing the blend factor $\alpha$,
which is based on the position of the viewer and the position of the vertex in world-space.
This factor $\alpha$ is defined such that it is 0 everywhere except at the transition region,
which then linearly grows to 1 until reaching the border.

During rendering, view-frustum culling is performed by intersecting each block with the view-frustum,
and if the AABB of the block does not intersect the view-frustum, it does not get rendered.

Shading is performed with a normal map, which has twice the resolution of the heightmap.
The normal map is computed whenever the clipmap gets updated.

\subsection{Concurrent Binary Trees}
The \textit{concurrent binary tree (CBT)} is a data structure published by Dupuy in 2020.
It essentially allows for binary trees to be computed in parallel using a binary heap 
stored as a bitfield. This allows for easy concurrent manipulation of tree nodes using bitwise operations.
The data structure is applicable to problems relying on binary trees, 
such as the \textit{longest edge bisection}.

The paper contains a section describing the application of CBTs to terrain rendering.
The approach is similar to \cite{roam} in the sense that it computes a triangulation of the terrain using bintree splitting and merging.
The main difference is that the spliting and merging of the bintrees happens in parallel on compute shaders with the 
CBT data structure, whereas in \cite{roam}, the bintrees are split and merged on the CPU.
The split and merge criteria are defined such that sub-pixel rasterization is avoided.
Triangles outside of the view-frustum and triangles at flat areas are not split or merged further.

Dupuy claims

An issue which is not adressed in the paper is how popping is avoided in the terrain.

\subsection{Conclusion}
In this subsection, the algorithms and their suitability for implementation are discussed.

\paragraph{ROAM} ROAM is not particularly suited for today's GPU, since it mainly relies 
on immediate mode rendering \cite{geomclipmaps}, which is outdated in most graphics APIs of today.
In addition to this, the costly splits and merges of the priority queues happen entirely on the CPU,
which is undesirable.

\paragraph{GeoMipMapping} The strongest point of GeoMipMapping is the fact that its easy to understand and 
to implement.
GeoMipMapping was published at a time in which immediate mode was widely-used.
Nowadays, mmediate mode is deprecated in most graphics APIs.
In order for GeoMipMapping to be suitable for modern GPUs, it needs to be modified such that 
it can work with vertex and index buffers, which is feasible thanks to its block-based nature.

\paragraph{Geometry Clipmaps} GPU-based Geometry Clipmaps was one of the first algorithms to utilize 
the vertex texturing functionality of GPU, which was newly introduced at the time of its publication.
The fact that only very few vertices and indices are required (which are translated and scaled during rendering to their corresponding position) 
and the fact that the heightmap can be sampled in the vertex shader makes GPU-based Geometry Clipmaps still a suitable 
approach for modern hardware. This is reflected in the fact that the most widely-used Godot plugin for heightmap rendering 
is based on GPU-based Geometry Clipmaps, (see the next section).
Some other strong points are the transition regions for avoiding pops, its configurability, and the fact that 
no LOD determination has to be performed, since the mesh is constant.

\paragraph{CBT} The CBT data structure ``revitalized'' mesh-subdivision-based approaches, such as \cite{lindstrom1996,roam},
since bintrees can now be computed in parallel with compute shaders, rather than on the CPU. However, some aspects are not yet handled, such as 
preventing pops. It is a rather new approach that has not yet been tested in the real-world.

\paragraph{Overall Conclusion}
Overall, algorithms which load the vertices and indices once to the GPU and do not touch the buffers again 


\section{Terrain LOD in Real-world Systems}
\subsection{Game Engines}
\subsubsection{Godot}
Godot is a cross-platform game engine written in C\#, C++ and its own scripting language GDScript.
Terrains are supported in form of extensions developed by community members, 
which can be installed and used in Godot projects by game developers.

One such extension is Terrain3D by Cory Petkovsek \cite{godotterrain3dgithub} 
written in C++ for Godot 4. The LOD approach used in this extension is based on 
geometry clipmaps by Hoppe and Losasso \cite{geomclipmaps}. % TODO Explain algo in high-level fashion
The concrete implementation
of the geometry clipmap mesh code was created by Mike J Savage \cite{geomclipmapssavage}. 

% TODO https://github.com/Zylann/godot_heightmap_plugin/blob/11e0db92c2f8e0e907ae173b983d73af1e35c4c2/addons/zylann.hterrain/doc/docs/index.md
Another extension for terrains is Godot Heightmap Plugin by Marc Gilleron \cite{godotheightmapplugingithub} written in GDScript and C++.
The extension uses a quadtree-based approach for terrain LOD. 

\subsubsection{Unity}
Unity is another cross-platform game engine written in C\# and C++, and has a 
built-in terrain system. 
The core engine source code of Unity is only accessible
by owning an enterprise licence, therefore no information is given on which 
specific terrain LOD algorithm is used for the built-in terrain in Unity.
Instead, a high-level overview of Unity's terrain system is given 
and some additional information on related projects.

The terrain system supports importing and exporting of heightmaps in 
the RAW file format, with either an 8-bit or 16-bit grayscale value per pixel.
Visually, the mesh of the terrain LOD resembles that from a quadtree-based LOD approach, such as \cite{chunkedlod}.
The Unity terrain does not perform any morphing between different LOD levels,
which means that pops are visible at LOD level changes.

There exists an open-source library for hierarchical LOD in Unity called HLODSystem developed by JangKyu Seo at Unity TODO citation .
HLODSystem also supports terrains with its TerrainHLOD component, allowing for conversion from an Unity Terrain object to a HLOD mesh with configurable parameters, such as chunk size and border vertex count.
HLODSystem allows the developer to specify the mesh simplifier to be used and currently the only supported simplifier is UnityMeshSimplifier, 
an open-source mesh simplifier developed by TODO that utilizes the fast quadratic mesh simplification algorithm developed by Sven Forstmann TODO citation.

The previously described CBT data structure and its application to terrain rendering was published by Dupuy 
at Unity Labs. 
At SIGGRAPH Courses 2021, Deliot et al. gave a talk in which they described some additional implementation details 
and the (potential) integration into the Unity game engine. As of today, Unity does not yet use 
the CBTs for its terrain system.

\subsubsection{Unreal Engine}
Unreal Engine is another cross-platform game engine written in C++ and features
an integrated terrain system called the Landscape system.

The maximum supported heightmap size is $8192 \times 8192$.


\subsubsection{Frostbite}
Frostbite is a closed-source game engine developed by DICE and is known for the \textit{Battlefield} series.
DICE has held numerous talks in the last few years describing iterations of their
terrain system.
During the Game Developers Conference 2012, DICE presented the terrain system of \textit{Battlefield 3}, which was developed with their Frostbite 2 engine.
They mention a quadtree-based terrain LOD system and describe several optimizations regarding paging and streaming of terrain.
