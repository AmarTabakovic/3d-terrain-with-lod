\chapter{Terrain LOD in Real-world Systems}
This chapter lists a selection of real-world examples of terrain LOD algorithms in use,
such as game engines and geographic information systems (GIS).
\section{Game Engines}
\subsection{Godot}
Godot is a cross-platform game engine written in C\#, C++ and its own scripting language GDScript.
Terrains are supported in form of extensions developed by community members, which can be installed and used in Godot projects by game developers.
One such extension is Terrain3D by Cory Petkovsek \cite{godotterrain3dgithub} 
written in C++ for Godot 4. The LOD approach used in this extension is based on 
geometry clipmaps by Hoppe and Losasso \cite{geomclipmaps}. % TODO Explain algo in high-level fashion
The concrete implementation
of the geometry clipmap mesh code was created by Mike J Savage \cite{geomclipmapssavage}. 
\subsection{Unity}
\subsection{Unreal Engine}
Unreal Engine is another cross-platform game engine written in C++ and features
an integrated terrain system (called the Landscape system).
The technical documentation of Unreal Engine 5 mentions utilising geomipmapping for 
handling LOD for landscapes \cite{unrealengine5doc}. Geomipmapping is a terrain LOD approach developed 
in 2000 by de Boer \cite{geomipmapping}. % TODO Explain algo in high-level fashion
