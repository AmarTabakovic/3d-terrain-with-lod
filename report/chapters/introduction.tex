\chapter{Introduction}
In the field of 3D computer graphics, rendering is one of the central tasks.
Many practical applications of 3D computer graphics make use of terrains, 
such as flight simulators, open-world video games, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) \cite[p.~185]{lodfor3dgraphics}.
At the same time, rendering large and constantly visible objects, such as the terrain, is computationally expensive 
and optimizations are necessary in order to avoid performance deficiencies.

One area which offers potential for optimizations is the \textit{level of detail (LOD)} of objects.
The concept of LOD is based on the idea that the farther away an object is, the fewer details are going to be visible to the human eye.

The problem of rendering terrains spawned numerous algorithms and approaches specifically
for this purpose. 

\section{Goals of this Project}
%The goals of this project can be formulated as follows:
The main goal of this project is to gain an overview over the field of 
terrain LOD. This includes analyzing and comparing a selection of terrain LOD algorithms and approaches,
including implementing as part of a demo computer application.
