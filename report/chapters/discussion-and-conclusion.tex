\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}
\section{Further Work}
ATLOD can be extended in a number of ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Additional terrain LOD algorithms: ATLOD currently only supports GeoMipMapping. Some interesting and relevant algorithms that could be added 
        are GPU-based Geometry Clipmaps, CDLOD and Concurrent Binary Trees.
  \item Terrain streaming/paging: currently, ATLOD only loads a single instance of \texttt{GeoMipMapping}. ATLOD could be extended to load multple 
        instances with dynamic loading and offloading of instances and heightmaps, which would allow for even larger (theoretically infinite) terrains.
\end{itemize}
